# √çscar Territory ‚Äì Historical-Geographical QGIS Project

This QGIS project explores the historical and territorial development of the √çscar area (Valladolid, Spain), focusing primarily on the Early and High Middle Ages. The project reconstructs spatial hypotheses based on historical sources, scholarly interpretations, and geographical features such as the Pir√≥n River basin and surrounding moorlands.

## üìç Project Context

√çscar is situated in the **Tierra de Pinares** region, an area characterized by extensive pine forests already noted in the Late Middle Ages. This QGIS project visualizes the possible extent and structure of the medieval √çscar territory, synthesizing available historical evidence and hypotheses from leading scholarship.

## üè∞ Key Historical Elements

- **Castle of √çscar**: Referenced in Arab chronicles during the 939 campaign of Abd-al-Rahman III (Ibn Hayyan 1981), although the current structure dates from the Late Middle Ages. The earlier fortress may have stood slightly west of the current location.
  
- **Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a**: Cited in connection to the castle and likely corresponds with the current Church of Santa Mar√≠a inside the town of √çscar.

## üìê Territorial Boundaries and Hypotheses

### Traditional View (Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, 1983)
- Defines a 167 km¬≤ territory including:
  - Cogeces de √çscar
  - Pedrajas de San Esteban
  - Fuente el Olmo de √çscar
  - Remondo
  - Megeces
  - Villanueva de √çscar

### Revised Hypothesis (Based on Ecclesiastical and Topographic Evidence)
- Early territory (~110 km¬≤) likely structured around:
  - Flat plains south of √çscar along the **Pir√≥n River**
  - Moorlands to the north of √çscar as complementary landscape
- Possible later extension in the **second third of the 12th century** into the **Cega Valley**, though uncertain.

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Objectives

- Visualize the hypothesized extent of √çscar‚Äôs territory across time
- Highlight strategic features: rivers, elevations, forests
- Contextualize key sites (e.g., castle, church, nearby settlements)
- Suggest territorial evolution before and after the 12th century
